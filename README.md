# radix-withdraw
Python script to do a withdraw (Mainnet or Stokenet)
(If you don't have a wallet you can see my wallet generator repository)

This script is on stokenet with comments that's will help you to use it throught radix mainnet (NetworkID and Gateway)
If you started like le by using radix-dev-console using transaction manifest you are ready to use this code.

The main goal will be to just put you transaction manifest on this script, i will upload more generic script always on python.
